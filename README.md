# React Form Steps

This is the repository code for a tutorial I did on how to create a custom multi-step form from scratch using React Context API, as well as React Hook Form for form validation.

The key takeaway from this project is to understand how we can conditionally render components based on state.

You can watch the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGAKcysQiwc)
